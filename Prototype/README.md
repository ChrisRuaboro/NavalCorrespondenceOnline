# Prototype *ready for review*

Hi! So for my prototype i did it all in Adobe Photoshop. Mostly because I really wanted to capture all of the little details I wanted on my application. I think doing it in Photoshop can be similarly inferred to the flowchart of my project.


## Screenshots

 1. HomePage

![HomePage](https://github.com/ChrisRuaboro/NavalCorrespondenceOnline/blob/master/Prototype/Screenshots/01Home.png)

I really like the essence and style of a web page that infinite scrolls. With the home page i want to keep my logo at the top left (still in design), have a drop down menu, and a log in button. Since my project is still in the works i added a projected end date.

2. Menu drop down icon![Home menu](https://github.com/ChrisRuaboro/NavalCorrespondenceOnline/blob/master/Prototype/Screenshots/02Home-menu.png)
Trying to keep to a minimalist vibe I don't overload the menu with pages. The drop down menu will invert colors on hovered over giving it a separated feel when selecting.

3. About section![About Page](https://github.com/ChrisRuaboro/NavalCorrespondenceOnline/blob/master/Prototype/Screenshots/03About.png)
Has some filler text in there but in this section will go a summary of what Naval Correspondence Online has to offer. The way i want this implemented is scrolling up with the section on its own background. The background of the previous page will stay static until the section passes over where the next section background will load.

4. Pricing![Pricing](https://github.com/ChrisRuaboro/NavalCorrespondenceOnline/blob/master/Prototype/Screenshots/04Pricing.png)
Nothing much to talk about here. It will still follow the infinite scroll vibe i'm looking for.

5. The Team
![The team](https://github.com/ChrisRuaboro/NavalCorrespondenceOnline/blob/master/Prototype/Screenshots/05TheTeam.png)
If there is every a team working on this site, this is where their info would go. For now, it's just me myself and I.

6.Contact Page
![Contact Page](https://github.com/ChrisRuaboro/NavalCorrespondenceOnline/blob/master/Prototype/Screenshots/06Contact.png)
Thought about implementing a way to redirect user to a new email form when contactus email would be pressed. I will implement in the future, but the text will suffice. Eventually i would love to have a social media presence with this project. The twitter link will redirect the user to twitter. No plans on other social media platforms.

7. Login/Signup form
![html login](https://github.com/ChrisRuaboro/NavalCorrespondenceOnline/blob/master/Prototype/Screenshots/07Login.Signup-form.png)
Once login is pressed the background will darken and the login form will zoom in. From there the user will enter their info to login.

8. Plain dashboard
![dashboard plain](https://github.com/ChrisRuaboro/NavalCorrespondenceOnline/blob/master/Prototype/Screenshots/08Dashboard.png)
What the dash board will be is a main hub to where you utilize the program. Plan is to have a side bar to navigate the dashboard and the top bar to navigate the site.

9. Dashboard With Templates
![dashboard templates](https://github.com/ChrisRuaboro/NavalCorrespondenceOnline/blob/master/Prototype/Screenshots/09-Dashboard-with-templates.png)
User will be allowed to access their old templates or create new ones. I imagine a search bar for templates. This will allow ease of finding certain documents. Each of the documents will either have the template name or the document name on them.

10.Sidebar open view
![Dashboard open sidebar](https://github.com/ChrisRuaboro/NavalCorrespondenceOnline/blob/master/Prototype/Screenshots/10Sidebar-open.png)
This side bar will expand to allow the user more clarification of the tools. Still deciding if it would be a hover feature or click to expand.

11.Editing template
![Editing](https://github.com/ChrisRuaboro/NavalCorrespondenceOnline/blob/master/Prototype/Screenshots/11-Editing-document.png)
Likely the main portion of my program. The user will have the ability to change the logo just by right clicking it. The date portion of the template will pull up a calendar allowing the user to easily have a date properly formatted. This picture show just portions of the document but encompasses all of the features. Blue highlighted lines will be input boxes to where the user can input their data. once the user inputs their data properly.
